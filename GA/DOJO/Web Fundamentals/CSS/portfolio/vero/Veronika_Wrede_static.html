                <p>
                    One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one
                        of my haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my
                        presence. I seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he
                        inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth. The
                        fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself no
                        longer. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight
                        from my body; and a more than fiendish malevolence, ginnurtured,
                        thrilled every fibre of my frame. I took from my
                        waistcoat-pocket a penknife, opened it, grasped the poor
                        beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its eyes from
                        the socket!

                        The corpse, already greatly decayed and
                        clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes of the
                        spectators. Upon its head, with red extended mouth and
                        solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had
                        seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had
                        consigned me to the hangman. I had walled the monster up
                        within the tomb.
