- train-test split

- see sklearn metrics.<stuff> to check out different metrics for evaluating models

Does accuracy define the quality of a classification model?

- think critically...
- cancer example (if 1% of people have cancer, and the model is "def cancer(person) / return False", it's 99% accurate but it's a terrible model)
- must think critically about what we are trying to predict

Thoughts on testing and training with the same dataset...

- generally "overfit"
- does well when tested using in-sample data
- might do poorly when testing out-of-sample
- learns the noise with the signal

Unpacking...

- can return certain variables from functions at a time
- for ex:

def min_max(nums)
  smallest = min(nums)
  largest = max(nums)
  return [smallest, largest]

minimum, maximum = min_max([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print minimum
print maximum

1
5



Searching for the "best" value of k...

- You can write a loop that loops over K, re-instantiates the model with the K value, re-calculates training and testing errors

k_range = range(1, k)
training_error = []
testing_error = []

for k in k_range:
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    knn.fit(X, y)
    y_pred_class = knn.predict(X)
    training_accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y, y_pred_class)
    training_error.append(1 - training_accuracy)
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred_class = knn.predict(X_test)
    testing_accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_class)
    testing_error.append(1 - testing_accuracy)



Cross validation is generally more accurate than train-test split, but it takes more time (also a "sign of expertise in machine learning")



- The cancer-model (99% accurate model that's terrible because it never actually predicts cancer) example was really helpful in terms of explaining both "why accuracy doesn't define quality of a model" and also what null accuracy means.
- The graphical example bias/variance was helpful to visualize the trade-offs.
- Thanks for telling us about pip install/conda install
- Appreciated telling us "the best students apply techniques immediately to project dataset..."



"pip install selenium" or "conda install selenium"
