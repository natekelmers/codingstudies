First I need to confirm as fast as possible:

- Can I get my data?
- (Can I get the personality types of the users? Can I get the songs those users listened to?)

- In data science experiments: you need the response first
- I need to confirm if I can get the response (y) (the mbti)
- What's the everything else that could help? (x)

- product managers: direct the team on what to focus on (what's our feature?)
- what business metric is this feature tied to? (the y)
- in a data sense: what data/information/etc do we need to guide that development? (the x)

- can I keep my team on this topic?
