Don't worry about the "create a dictionary in which the key is the airline name..." question yet

11-2 pm Saturday impromptu "intro to python"

The Command Line:

CLI is a way of interacting with your computer using text-based commands (rather than GUI)

Generally:

<command> -<options> <arguments>

Basic, helpful commends:

"ls -l"        = lists files w extra info
"ls -a"        = lists files w hidden files (such as git repositories)
"ls *"         = lists files w extra info in long format (good if you don't know where something is)
"ls <path>"    = lists files in another place

"cd <path>"    = this lets you pick a folder/directory to do stuff in
"cd .."        = go up one
"cd"           = home

"mkdir <name>" = makes a new directory
"touch <name>" = makes a new file

"mv <file> <dir> "         = moves a file
"mv <file> <dir/new_name>" = moves it and renames it

"cp <file> <dir>           = copies a file
"cp <file> <dir/new_name>" = copies and renames

"rm <file>"    = deletes a file pretty much for good
"rm -i <file>" = deletes a file but asks "are you sure"

"*"            = any string of characters in this spot
"?"            = any one character in this spot

- generally, '-i' means 'information', and will ask you "are you sure" when you do stuff
- also, '-ir' means 'information/recursive', which is great for directories (will ask you "go in here?" > "remove this file? > "remove that file?" > "delete directory?"



Intermediate, cool commands:

"head <file>"     = prints the first 10 lines of something
"head -n20 <file> = prints the first 20 lines of something

"find <path> -name <*file*>" = shows the names of stuff in directories with certain names

"grep <stuff> <file>"        = shows stuff inside a file with certain info (for ex: grep Airline airlines.csv will print stuff with the word "Airline" in it)

"|"               = chains commands together

Random thoughts...

- Microsoft word files are xml files, basically text files with tons of structure around them
- This means if python looks at your word file it will get screwed up
- Other options exist (Sublime, Vim, etc) (Alex uses Sublime)

- Vim is crazy weird but good so we should learn some basic Vim stuff, like...
  "esc"                   = lets you type at the bottom
  "(shift) + (":") > "q!" = quit vim

- Start looking at final project examples to figure out what you want to do

- There's some sick advanced python stuff if you just scroll down on the GA/DS-DC-25

- Contributing to the overall community of Github is a good way to build your profile/resume (especially helping with good-but-poorly-documented code)
- Alex committed to "gensim"... how do you find the right stuff to commit to?

- Consider checking out videos by Linus Torvald (git), Oliver G (scikit-learn)

Personal repository:

$ git config --global user.name "<name>"

$ git config --global user.email "<email>"

$ git clone <url>



To pull from the master (START OF EVERY CLASS):

$ git pull upstream master



To get new stuff:

$ git status              = checks to see if everything is up to date
$ git add <file>          = adds file to staging area
$ git reset HEAD <file>   = removes file from staging area
$ git commit -m <message> = commits your file to upstream with the message you wanted
$ git log                 = view commit history (just in case)
$ git push origin master  = merge it with the master
