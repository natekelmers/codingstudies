- microsoft's wallpaper feature (that randomizes nice pretty photos)
- includes a "like what you see? thanks for sending us feedback. we'll use it to improve this feature in the (not too distant) future"

- in terms of a data science feature, how should we look at this to optimize the feature?

- picks images to show you randomly, ideally wants to show you only the good ones

- false positive = "showed me an image, i didn't click 'like'"
- true positive = "showed me an image, i did click 'like'"

---

- if our data is only filled with 0s ("dislike") and 1s ("like"), how do we classify?
- can't use a strict linear regression
- instead, bind (-infinity, infinity) to (0, 1), create a sigmoid curve
- allows for both a prediction and a confidence for each prediction
