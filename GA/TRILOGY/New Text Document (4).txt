2018-06-18 CONVO WITH SASHA

- Data is hard to fill!
- Most students have another job, know what their next step in their career is
- This is the end of the ride! (remember the "getting tired" feeling?)

- Class is a little quieter than normal right now, try to help students out a little
- Make them feel like they have the support however you can (talk to the students, check the slack channel, etc etc etc)

- Check attendence when class starts, slack them if they stay "none" by 7ish

- Make sure you grade your papers (homework is always due on saturdays)
- Filter by ungraded, click "submitted link _", 
- Grading rubrics should be there on GitHub

- On BootCampSpot, if you can't answer a question, try the live chat (when green)
- Or, submit a ticket

- GitLab is the cohort-specific repository
- So, if I need to grade a homework, use GitLab, and pull down the specific resources
