Visualization

---

- Why are visualization's important?
- See anscombe's quartet
- Each of those 4 plots have the same mean, standard dev, r2, x and y intercepts for regressions, etc

---

Basics of plotting:

- Bread and butter includes: bar, box, hisogram, line, scatter
- Other good ones: swarm, violin

- Charts that suck: pie charts (see how much better the bar graphs are?)

Matplotlib stuff...

"<shift> + <tab>" inside a method shows all of its parameters

To start working:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 6)
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 17
plt.style.use('seaborn-white') ("ggplot", "seaborn-white" are good ones)

names = []
url = ""
data = pd.read_csv(url, header=0, names=names, na_filter=False)

---

Look again at:

- adding x and y labels/titles
- overlapping histograms and using plt.show()
- making "binz" (bins of equal width)
- converting dates or times into datetime objects
- joe's finished code (for extra features for gridspec)

---

Useful:

- "set([type(i) for i in <dataset>])" will quickly tell you what types of data are in your set
- (helps with cleansing)
