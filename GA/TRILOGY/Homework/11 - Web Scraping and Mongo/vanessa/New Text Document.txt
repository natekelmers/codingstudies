Vanessa, nice work. All the solutions look good. My only suggestion would be not to leave your soup objects printed in the notebook. The length of the text will make the notebook difficult to navigate, and occasionally, prevent browsers from loading the notebook via GitHub (I do agree printing the soup object is really helpful for your work though).
