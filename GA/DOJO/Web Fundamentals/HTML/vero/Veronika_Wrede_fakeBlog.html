	<h3>The pictures describe my life pretty well:</h3>
	</center>

	<ol>
		<li>First and foremost is my cat. I love her very much and she is the most important person in my life. My husband had to learn that the hard way</li>
		<li>Second: I love chocolate. So much so that not too,ong ago I threw away College and myself into the chocolate business.</li>
		<li>Third: I have a second daughter called Leonard (we though she was a boy at first, she's really notvery lady like). I love her, but not as much as her sister - yes, I know that I'll rot in hell fro this.</li>
		<li>Because I'm a very angry and scary person I need to go to the gym every day and eat lots of weight so that my body is too heavy to chase ofter people. My metabolism is super fast though, so I have to do it every day.</li>
		<li>Lastly: I really like baking! I can't eat it, cuz, you know, gluten and double sentence in hell and all that but I love baking.</li>
		<li>Now this is post lastly cuz I couldtn find a picture but I also love dancing.</li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
		<li>Oh and I forgot my husband. He's somewhere. If the snake had eaten him I'd know, so he is somewhere.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>I foster these kittens from as early as birth until they can eat and go to the loo by themselves. If you are interested in doing the same (it is a lot of fun!) look for a kitten nursery near you! you can chose age range and duration of fostering to fit you're experience level and time =) </h3>
